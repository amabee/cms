## 📚 Documentation Created

### 1. **API_DOCUMENTATION.md**
Complete API reference with:
- All endpoints and operations
- Request/response examples
- Parameter specifications
- Error handling guide
- Security notes
- Database table reference

### 2. **FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md**
Frontend integration guide with:
- Common API call pattern
- Page-by-page integration examples

- Error handling
- Testing checklist

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Database Setup
```sql
-- Run the schema.sql file to create all tables
mysql -u root -p clinic_cms < backend/schema.sql
```

### 2. Test Backend APIs
Test each endpoint using a tool like Postman or directly from the frontend.

Example test for users:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost/cms/backend/users.php" \
  -d "operation=getAll" \
  -d "json={}"
```

### 3. Frontend Integration
Replace the TODO markers in each admin page with actual API calls using the examples in `FRONTEND_INTEGRATION.md`.

**Priority order:**
1. ✅ Dashboard - Load statistics
2. ✅ Users - Full CRUD operations
3. ✅ Doctors - Full CRUD + statistics
4. ✅ Staff - Full CRUD + statistics
5. ✅ Patients - Full CRUD + statistics
6. ✅ Profile - View & update
7. ✅ Settings - Load & save
8. ✅ Audit Logs - View & filter

### 4. Testing
- Test all CRUD operations
- Verify error handling
- Check audit log entries
- Test filters and search
- Verify statistics accuracy

### 5. Security Review
- Ensure session handler is working
- Verify authentication on all pages
- Test role-based access
- Check SQL injection protection
- Verify password hashing

**Admin Account:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`
- User ID: 1 (cannot be deleted)

**New Doctors:**

## 💡 Quick Start Example

Here's a complete example to test if everything is working:

```javascript
// 1. Login
const loginParams = new URLSearchParams();
loginParams.append('operation', 'login');
loginParams.append('json', JSON.stringify({
  username: 'admin',
  password: 'admin123'
}));

const loginResponse = await axios.post('backend/auth.php', loginParams);
SessionHandler.saveSession(loginResponse.data.user);

// 2. Get Dashboard Statistics
const dashParams = new URLSearchParams();
dashParams.append('operation', 'getStatistics');
dashParams.append('json', JSON.stringify({
  usertype_id: 1,
  user_id: 1
}));

const dashResponse = await axios.post('backend/dashboard.php', dashParams);
console.log('Dashboard Stats:', dashResponse.data);

// 3. Get All Users
const usersParams = new URLSearchParams();
usersParams.append('operation', 'getAll');
usersParams.append('json', JSON.stringify({}));

const usersResponse = await axios.post('backend/users.php', usersParams);
console.log('Users:', usersResponse.data);
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "Database Error: Table doesn't exist"**
- Run `schema.sql` to create all tables

**2. "Invalid Operation"**
- Check operation name spelling (case-sensitive)
- Verify you're using the correct endpoint

**3. "Password verification failed"**
- Make sure you're using the correct password
- For new users, use default passwords

**4. "User not found"**
- Check if the user_id or doctor_id exists
- Verify you're passing the correct ID field

**5. "Cannot delete user"**
- user_id = 1 (admin) is protected
- Check for foreign key constraints
